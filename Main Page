<head><h1>Engine Blows During the Cup Series</h1></head>
<h4>"Joey Pro Stock Involved in Big Wreck"</h4>

<p>
		During the Darlington Speedway race this last Sunday.
	Joey Pro Stock, watched his car go up in peices right in front of him.
	When the car blew up, his car caught wind and flipped over. The car slid
	for about 100 feet until it stopped. The AMR saftey team put a caughtion on the
	race and the other racers slowed down. The team went and put out the
	fire that had started in the engine area of the car. Once it was out, they
	pulled Joey out and got him to safety. The team then hooked up a tow truck
	to the car and got it off the track. No other racers were injured during
	this accident, and thankfully Joey was ok once checked out by doctors.

		The Race was able to then continue once the track cleaners came and dried
	up any other liquides that were spilled from Joey's car. Joey told me after
	race that <i>"It was indeed fun. But I could have died at the same time."</i>
	After the wreck the race continued and there were still two other big crashes,
	thankfully no one was injured, but it did cause the winner,
	to be someone non expectant of winning the race. Mark Decker ended up
	winning at Darlington. He was able to pass Chris Alexander last second,
	due to loss of gas in his car. Because of Joey's accident, Chris chose to stay out
	instead of pitting, in hopes for better track position. Their team also thought
	they could make it anyways, but ended up being wrong. Mark is now in the playoffs,
	and now could be a <strong>threat</strong> to other playoff drivers.
